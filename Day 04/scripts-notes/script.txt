ðŸ“Œ npm Scripts in Node.js

1. Location:
   - Scripts are defined inside package.json under "scripts".
   - Example:
     {
       "scripts": {
         "start": "node index.js",
         "dev": "nodemon index.js",
         "test": "echo \"Running tests...\""
       }
     }

2. Run Command:
   - Syntax â†’ npm run <scriptName>
   - Example â†’ npm run dev

3. Default Scripts:
   - "start": npm start   (no need to type 'npm run start')
   - "test":  npm test    (no need to type 'npm run test')

4. Default PATH:
   - When running npm scripts, node_modules/.bin is added to PATH automatically.
   - This means you can use local binaries (like nodemon, eslint, webpack) 
     without installing them globally or typing full paths.
   - Example:
     "dev": "nodemon index.js"   // nodemon is picked from node_modules/.bin

5. Why Useful?
   - Shortcuts for commands.
   - Keeps project setup consistent across machines.
   - Lets you chain multiple commands (with && or &&).

6. Example Usage:
   npm start        â†’ runs "node index.js"
   npm run dev      â†’ runs "nodemon index.js"
   npm test         â†’ runs your test command
