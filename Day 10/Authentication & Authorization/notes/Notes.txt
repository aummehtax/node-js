// AUTHENTICATION - "Who are you?"
// - Process of verifying the identity of a user
// - Proves you are who you claim to be
// - Example: Logging in with username and password
// - Like showing your ID card at the entrance

// AUTHORIZATION - "What can you do?"
// - Process of determining what an authenticated user can access
// - Defines permissions and access rights
// - Example: Admin can delete users, regular user cannot
// - Like having different key cards for different rooms after entering the building

// Simple flow:
// 1. Authentication happens first (login)
// 2. Authorization happens after (checking permissions)

// Real-world example:
// Authentication: You log into Facebook with email/password
// Authorization: You can edit YOUR posts, but not other people's posts
