/*
ðŸ“Œ Middleware in Express.js

1. What is Middleware?
   - Middleware is like a "helper function" that sits between the request (from user) and the response (from server).

2. How it works:
   - Request comes in â†’ Middleware runs â†’ Then goes to next middleware/route â†’ Finally sends response.

3. Uses of Middleware:
   - Logging requests (who visited, when).
   - Checking authentication (is user logged in?).
   - Parsing data (like JSON, form inputs).
   - Handling errors.

4. Key point:
   - Middleware always has access to (req, res, next).
   - `next()` â†’ passes control to the next function in the chain.

âœ… In short: Middleware = Functions that process requests before sending the final response.
