📌 Routing in Express.js

1. What is Routing?
   - Routing means deciding how an app responds to different URLs (paths) and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

2. Example in real life:
   - Like directions in Google Maps → “If user goes to /home → show homepage”.
   - Different routes = different responses.

3. In Express:
   - app.get('/home', ...) → Runs when user visits /home with GET request.
   - app.post('/login', ...) → Runs when user submits form data to /login.

4. Why useful?
   - Organizes your server to handle multiple pages/endpoints.
   - Makes backend code cleaner and structured.

✅ In short: Routing = "URL + HTTP method → What server should do".
